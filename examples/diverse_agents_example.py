Diverse Agents Example - DynaVox Framework

This example demonstrates running a simulation with highly diverse agents
and low homophily bias to encourage cross-group interactions.

The simulation creates 20 agents with varied:
- Personality traits (using different personality biases)
- Age ranges (from young adults to elderly)
- Socioeconomic backgrounds
- Educational levels
- Occupations across different sectors
